### Event Logging
There are three flavors of logging supported by the Daily Logs plugin - **Append**, **Header** and **Field** events:

- [[Append Logging]]
   - Append logging adds a formatted line of text to the end of the daily log

- [[Header Logging]]
   - Header logging adds text inside a specific header section of the daily log

- [[Field Logging]]
   - Field logging is used to replace a custom `{{field}}` inside your daily log
