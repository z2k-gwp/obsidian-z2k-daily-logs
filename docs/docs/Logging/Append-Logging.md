The Z2K Daily Logs plugin supports [multiple ways](https://github.com/z2k-gwp/obsidian-z2k-daily-logs/wiki/Event-Logging) to log events throughout the day. One method is via "Append Logging". 

## Overview
- Append logging adds a formatted line of text to the end of the daily log
- Append logging is useful for logging simple events and actions that occur throughout the day
- Most often, these events are comma separated lists, but can be custom formatted in settings
- Append logging is intended for use with a single line of text (see below)
- The format of the appended line can be configured in the plugin settings page
- Example automated events: Card/Note creation, system backups, card modifications, change of location, motion detectors, etc.
