The Z2K Daily Logs plugin supports [multiple ways](https://github.com/z2k-gwp/obsidian-z2k-daily-logs/wiki/Event-Logging) to log events throughout the day. One method is via "Header Logging". 

## Overview
- Header logging adds text inside a specific header section of the daily log
- Header logging is useful for more complicated events
- Tagged events oftentimes consist of multiple lines, and have #hashTag tagging inside them
- The structure of tagged events is application dependent - anything passing Tagged Event data is responsible for how the data appears
- Example tagged events: Exercise Run, Phone Call, Calorie Count, Headache Tracking, Vocabulary Words
