## Getting Started
To get started, please checkout:
- You'll need to know what [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is of course
- Although not required, it is useful to learn about log files in the [Z2K System](https://z2k.dev). 
    - In particular, this plugin helps move your daily notes file from being [_notes_-centric to a broader _logs_-centric mindset](Interoperability/Daily-Note-vs-Daily-Log), allowing it to capture and log events from your life. 
    - While this plugin is part of the Z2K System, it can be used as a standalone plugin for normal Obsidian users for their own systems.
    - These pages refers to the "daily notes" as "daily logs", because they are used to not just capture notes, but to log events and data as well. You can make your Daily Note be your Daily Log, or configure the system so that [they are separate](Advanced/File-Naming#have-daily-notes-alongside-daily-logs).
